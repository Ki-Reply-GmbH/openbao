# Auto Unseal Plugins

### Summary

This RFC proposes a new OpenBao plugin type that enables the distribution
of Auto Unseal mechanisms/providers as separate plugin binaries, much like
the other existing types of OpenBao plugins work. This addresses outstanding
concerns on adding additional Auto Unseal providers revolving around dependency
minimization, maintenance burden, and release processes.

### Problem Statement

At the time of writing, OpenBao supports 9 separate Auto Unseal mechanisms. Most
of these are vendor/provider-specific:

- [AliCloud KMS](../configuration/seal/alicloudkms.mdx)
- [AWS KMS](../configuration/seal/awskms.mdx)
- [Azure Key Vault](../configuration/seal/azurekeyvault.mdx)
- [GCP Cloud KMS](../configuration/seal/gcpckms.mdx)
- [OCI KMS](../configuration/seal/ocikms.mdx)
- [OpenBao Transit](../configuration/seal/transit.mdx)

Additionally, generic vendor-free mechanisms include:

- [KMIP](../configuration/seal/kmip.mdx)
- [PKCS#11](../configuration/seal/pkcs11.mdx)
- [Static Key](../configuration/seal/static.mdx)

All of the currently available mechanisms are statically compiled into the
released OpenBao binary, with the exception of PKCS#11, which is only available
in the HSM distribution of OpenBao because it requires CGO.

Furthermore, requests to merge additional vendor-specific mechanisms have been
received (usually along with a Pull Request ready for review):

- [Naver Cloud](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping/pull/6)
- [NHN Cloud SKM](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping/pull/47)
- [OVHcloud KMS](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping/pull/68)
- [Open Telekom Cloud](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping/pull/63)
- [OpenStack Barbican](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/1114)

Some more providers already have (presumably working) code present in-tree in
[go-kms-wrapping](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping), but haven't been
integrated into the main repository:

- [Huawei Cloud KMS](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping/tree/main/wrappers/huaweicloudkms)
- [Tencent Cloud KMS](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping/tree/main/wrappers/tencentcloudkms)
- [Securosys HSM](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping/tree/main/wrappers/securosyshsm)

The outstanding non-integrated providers are mostly regional from niche or
upcoming vendors that provide a KMS API.

OpenBao ultimately seeks to support all of the proposed Auto Unseal providers.
However, simply including all of these into the main binary seems naive:

1. Each provider usually comes with its own set of dependencies, e.g. an SDK
   package specific to the provider.
2. An OpenBao instance usually uses only one seal mechanisms at a time (two during
   [Seal Migration](../concepts/seal.mdx)). This number
   may increase with [Emergency Seals](./emergency-seal.mdx) or [Namespace
   Sealing](./namespace-sealing.mdx). However, it is unlikely for an instance to make
   use of a large variety of mechanisms at a time.
3. As outlined in [OpenBao's original Plugin
   Proposal](https://github.com/orgs/openbao/discussions/64), builtin integrations 
   with 3rd party components should be constrained to easily testable,
   OSI-licensed components. Other integrations will remain external to encourage
   broader community involvement in their maintenance.

This would lead to dependency and binary bloat, increased attack surface, and
increased complexity in release management. This RFC proposes to solve the
presented problem by enabling plugin support for Auto Unseal, using the same 
plugin mechanism that is already used for secrets, auth & database engines.

### User-facing Description

A new "kms" plugin type that provides pluggable external KMS functionality,
starting with Auto Unseal, will be introduced. These plugins will be
available as standalone binaries (and OCI images) just like current
secrets/auth/database plugins are. The source code of KMS plugins will live in
[go-kms-wrapping](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping), from where
they will also be released, separately from the main release schedule. Custom
3rd party plugins, which are not upstreamed into go-kms-wrapping, can also be 
built and used independently, though upstreaming will be encouraged.

In contrast to existing plugin types, KMS plugins can only be registered
[declaratively via the server configuration file](./config-plugins.mdx) and will
not be accessible over `sys/plugin/*` APIs except for read-only information.
Since Auto Seals naturally must initialize _before_ unsealing, following the
legacy API/storage-driven plugin lifecycle is not feasible. At the same time,
declarative plugin management is already generally preferred and recommended
over API-driven plugin management for all plugin types following their recent
introduction to OpenBao.

An example server configuration stanza is shown may look like this:

```hcl
plugin "kms" "opentelekomcloudkms" {
  command   = "openbao-plugin-opentelekomcloudkms"
  sha256sum = "b5bb9d8014a0f9b1d61e21e796d78dccdf1352f23cd32812f4850b878ae4944c"
}

seal "opentelekomcloudkms" {
  // as usual...
}
```

The value of `plugin_auto_register` is ignored. Traditionally, KMS plugins are
not registered and tracked in OpenBao's secure storage. As previously
mentioned, OCI-based plugin distribution will also be supported. KMS plugin
stanzas do not support the `version` field for now, but may do so in the future.

### Technical Description

The technical implementation of this RFC will be split into three parts, 1)
making the necessary plugin SDK available in go-kms-wrapping, 2) expanding
builds & releases in openbao-plugins to include the new plugin type, and 3)
integrating the new plugin type in the main OpenBao codebase.

#### go-kms-wrapping

At the heart of each Auto Unseal mechanism exists an implementation
of the `Wrapper` interface (+/- `InitFinalizer` interface) defined
in go-kms-wrapping. Coincidentally, Protobuf definitions and
[go-plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) gRPC server/client code
have been inherited into this repository from the original fork point. In fact,
most Go types in the `go-kms-wrapping/v2` package are already generated from
Protobuf. While untested, these definitions should allow for standalone binaries
that provide an instance of `Wrapper` over the go-plugin mechanism to be built.

A few passes will be needed to reach an operational state:

1. Get working what is already available.

2. Drop any unnecessary components of the protocol that are not needed for
   OpenBao's case. Apparently, the inherited definitions are used only by
   HashiCorp Boundary. Thus, it may be possible to omit some fields and
   features.

3. Modify the plugin SDK to replace the singleton `Wrapper` instance with
   a factory, enabling the on-demand creation of `Wrapper` instances. This
   mirrors the SDKs for existing secrets, auth & database plugins. This ensures
   compatibility with future OpenBao features requiring multiple `Wrapper`
   instances of the same type, such as Per-Namespace Sealing with multiple
   concurrent Auto Seals.

#### openbao-plugins

openbao-plugins will depend on the wrappers available in go-kms-wrapping and
expose them as plugin executables. While this leads to a slightly more complex
dependency graph, openbao-plugins has existing release infrastructure for other
plugin types that can be reused. Additionally, go-kms-wrapping can remain a pure
library repository as intended.

Required steps are:

1. Add a new `kms/` subtree to openbao-plugins and add packages with `main`
   functions for each wrapper in go-kms-wrapping that should be pluginized.

2. Adapt the `Makefile` to handle the new "kms" plugin type.

3. Ensure that the `Makefile` just as GitHub Actions workflows know to handle C
   (cross-)compilation to build the PKCS#11 plugin.

#### OpenBao

There will likely be more adaptation required than can be predicted here, but
some of the expected areas of work are:

- Adapting the OCI plugin downloader to download plugins _before_ unsealing (it
  currently does so _after_ unsealing).
- Ensuring KMS plugins are not registered into storage upon unseal, unlike other
  plugin types.
- Initializing KMS plugin processes before core is created and wiring up the
  created `Wrapper` in `command/server.go`, then handing them off to core for
  any further use.

### Rationale and Alternatives

Possible alternatives are:

- Compile all Auto Seal implementations into the main binary, avoiding plugin
  complexity.
- Require users to build soft-forked versions of OpenBao downstream to
  statically include the plugins they require.

Neither of these are in line with OpenBao's existing plugin-based philosophy.

### Downsides

Any kind of plugin requires operators to handle additional complexity. Based
on informal community observation many instances are operated without external
secrets, auth & database plugins. Apparently, the built-ins are sufficient for
most use cases, yet there is a large variety of choices when it comes to Auto
Unseal mechanisms. As a result, pluginized Auto Unseals may be the initial
and only reason for operators to concern themselves with managing plugins when
they did not need to beforehand. As a helping measure, it would be good to
publish guides around plugin operation in typical standard environments (e.g.,
Kubernetes) on the OpenBao website. These could be similar to existing guides
around HSM integration with PKCS#11.

### Security Implications

This change improves OpenBao's overall security posture by reducing the attack
surface of the average OpenBao installation and by enabling plug-and-play custom
Auto Unseal implementations if desired.

Furthermore, in terms of reliability, a panicking KMS plugin will not directly
affect other processes or cause the OpenBao instance to crash. Also, avoidance
of CGO addresses the warning from `go-plugins` [1] about loading dynamic
libraries into Vault not being acceptable for security reasons.

Additionally, this change will allow third parties to build their own Auto
Unseal plugins as they see fit. This is a double-edged sword: On one hand, this
can help comply with requirements not covered by the plugins offered officially
by the OpenBao project. On the other hand, plugin authors must be aware that
the integrity of an Auto Seal provider is of utmost importance to the overall
security of an OpenBao instance. Among others, a faulty or malicious Auto Unseal
plugin may lead to exposure or loss of root key material.

### User/Developer Experience

#### Users

See both [Downsides](#downsides) and [Security Implications](#security-implications).

#### Developers

Developers face no significant change w.r.t. the implementation and
maintenance of Auto Unseal wrappers. Additionally, they are enabled to
develop and release KMS plugins without coupling processes to the release
timeline of the main OpenBao binary (as long as no coordinated upgrades
are required due to breaking changes). In particular, regressions such as
[#2417](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/2417) could be addressed
sooner as the fix would only require a new plugin release, not a full OpenBao
patch release.

### Unresolved Questions

- Should currently built-in, vendor-specific Auto Unseal mechanisms eventually
  be phased out of the main binary and be made available as plugins only? For
  example, OpenBao v2.6 could support both currently built-in mechanisms and
  plugins, and then drop vendor-specific plugins in OpenBao v2.7. Additionally,
  the PKCS#11 seal is a particularly interesting candidate for pluginization
  as removing it from the main binary would allow for abandoning the HSM
  distribution, requiring only a CGO-based plugin binary and confining dynamic
  library loading to the plugin process.
